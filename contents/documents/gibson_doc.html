        <h1>Gibson Assembly Primer Designer</h1>
        
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>The Gibson Assembly module enables the seamless assembly of multiple DNA fragments in a single isothermal one-pot reaction through rational primer design with complementary overlap regions. This tool automates the creation of primers with optimized overlap sequences (typically 20–30 bp) that allow exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase enzymes to assemble DNA fragments without relying on restriction sites. Gibson Assembly is particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping, constructing large multi-fragment constructs, and flexible cloning where restriction sites may not be available.</p>

            <h2>Gibson Assembly Principle</h2>
            
            <p>Gibson Assembly is an isothermal, one-pot DNA assembly method that enables seamless joining of DNA fragments through <strong>homologous overlap</strong> regions without the need for restriction enzymes. In a single reaction, a <strong>5′ exonuclease</strong> resects the ends of double-stranded DNA fragments to generate complementary 3′ single-stranded overhangs, which anneal specifically between adjacent fragments. A <strong>high-fidelity DNA polymerase</strong> then fills in the remaining gaps using the annealed 3′ ends as primers, and a <strong>thermostable DNA ligase</strong> subsequently seals the nicks in the DNA backbone. Together, these coordinated enzymatic activities result in <strong>scarless assembly</strong> of multiple DNA fragments into a continuous double-stranded DNA molecule, making Gibson Assembly particularly suitable for constructing large or complex DNA constructs./p>

            <h3>Overlap Design Principle</h3>
            <p>The success of Gibson Assembly relies on the design of complementary overlap regions between adjacent DNA fragments. Each junction requires a pair of overlaps that are complementary in sequence and sufficient in length to support stable annealing during assembly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complementary Overlaps:</strong> The 3′ end of fragment i must be complementary to the 5′ end of fragment i + 1, ensuring specific annealing between adjacent fragments.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimal Overlap Length:</strong>Overlaps of <strong>20–30 bp</strong> are generally sufficient for most assemblies, balancing thermal stability and primer length; longer overlaps may improve robustness for complex or large constructs.</li>
                <li><strong>Seamless Junctions:</strong> Because overlaps are derived directly from native sequence, Gibson Assembly produces <strong>scar-free junctions</strong> without introducing additional residues.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Input Format</h2>
	    <p>Both vector and insert inputs accept <strong>FASTA or plain text format</strong>. Only <strong>one sequence</strong> is allowed per input field; if multiple FASTA headers are detected, <strong>only the first sequence</strong> will be used. Fragment names extracted from FASTA headers are displayed for reference and will be used in primer naming conventions.</p>
	     <p>PrimerWeaver currently supports approximately <strong>100 built-in Type II restriction enzymes</strong>. Once a vector sequence is provided, the system <strong>automatically identifies vector features</strong> and displays the positions of all <strong>single-cut restriction enzyme sites</strong>. The vector map can be rotated to facilitate visualization of the targeted cloning region.</p>

                >
            </div>

            <h3>Fragment Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add/Remove Fragments:</strong> Add multiple DNA sequences for multi-fragment assembly (2–10 fragments recommended; larger assemblies become more complex)</li>
                <li><strong>Reorder Fragments:</strong> Adjust assembly order using interface controls; order determines final construct architecture</li>
                <li><strong>Fragment Names:</strong> Auto-extracted from FASTA headers for clear primer identification; used in output reports</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Complement:</strong> Toggle individual fragments if needed to match desired orientation and assembly direction</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design Parameters</h2>
            
            <p>Please select the preferred vector linearization method, either <strong>Type II restriction enzyme digestion</strong> or <strong>PCR amplification</strong>. If restriction enzymes are used for vector linearization, specify whether the <strong>recognition sites should be retained or removed</strong> in the final construct. Once the restriction enzymes are selected, the system automatically identifies the <strong>longest fragment</strong> as the default destination vector backbone. If this fragment does not correspond to the intended backbone, you may manually select the appropriate fragment. Before proceeding, please review the <strong>primer design parameters</strong> and adjust them if necessary.</p>

            <h2>Primer Design Algorithm</h2>
            
            <h3>Primer Structure</h3>
            <p>Each Gibson Assembly primers consists of two functional regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Annealing core (3′):</strong> template-complementary region that drives PCR annealing (typically 18–30 bp)</li>

		<li><strong>Overlap Region (5′):</strong> Sequence complementary to an adjacent fragment that will be exposed after exonuclease digestion (typically 20–30 bp). </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>During Gibson Assembly primer design, PrimerWeaver first identifies and optimizes the <strong>annealing core (template-binding region)</strong> at the termini of each fragment. This region defines PCR annealing behavior and is iteratively adjusted to achieve the target melting temperature while satisfying basic QC constraints, including GC content and secondary structure avoidance. Once the annealing cores are fixed, <strong>junction-specific overlap regions</strong> are defined according to the user-specified fragment order. For each junction between adjacent fragments, PrimerWeaver assigns complementary overlap sequences derived from the fragment termini to ensure precise and directional annealing after exonuclease resection. Finally, full-length primers are constructed by concatenating the optimized annealing cores with the validated overlap regions, yielding primers that simultaneously amplify the desired fragments and introduce the required homologous overlaps for seamless Gibson Assembly.<p>
